# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow and VGG19

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for implementing Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow and the VGG19 model. NST is an algorithm that combines the content of one image with the style of another to generate a new image. In this case, the VGG19 model, pretrained on ImageNet, is used for feature extraction.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art.

## Getting Started

To run the NST algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Replace content image and the style image based on your preference**

4. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   python neural_style_transfer.py
